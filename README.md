*Variables (except enums), Robot config, and functions* are always *camelCase*
*Classes and enums* are always *PascalCase*
Drive motors will be names weather they front or rear + weather they are left or right (like
frontLeft, frontRight, rearLeft, rearRight)
In any order where 4 drive motors are needed, they must be in the order: frontLeft, frontRight,
rearLeft, rearRight
Whenever something is given a power, there should not be a stop() function. Instead, set the power
to 0 to stop it.
If there isn't a way to set power (like moveUp and moveDown) then there should be a stop() function.
